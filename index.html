             <h2>The Sacrificial Rose</h2>
             <p>
                The desolate realm has been cursed by the gods.
                
                The Iron Thorn stands as the lone surviving kingdom. Their hope rests in the hands of the Rose people, whose sacrifice holds the key to saving the realm from the eternal drought.
                
                For Elita, the burden of being a Rose weighs heavily upon her. Shrouded in secrecy, she exists under the shadow of her parentâ€™s desperate attempts to shield her from her inescapable fate.
                
                As she wrestles with her predetermined role, Elita is pushed toward a destiny she tried to escape. With the prompting of a ghost who haunts her dreams and the help of a kind stranger, she must uncover the secrets of the Rose people and the purpose of her own bloom.
                
                Elita's determination will be tested as she battles the choice to succumb to her fate or run from it. But in a land where the gods have forsaken their people, the price of hope may come at a haunting cost.</p>
